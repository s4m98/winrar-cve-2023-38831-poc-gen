# CVE-2023-38831 Exploit Generator

This tool is a Python script that exploits a vulnerability in the RAR file format (CVE-2023-38831) to execute a malicious command when a user opens a bait file. The exploit works on WinRAR versions before 6.23  .

## Requirements

- Python or python3


## Usage

There are two ways to use this tool:

- To generate a proof-of-concept exploit, run the script with the argument `poc`:

`python .\cve-2023-38831-exp-gen.py poc`

This will create a file named `CVE-2023-38831-poc.rar` that contains a fake PDF file named `CLASSIFIED_DOCUMENTS.pdf` and a batch file named `script.bat`. The batch file will run a simple command to open a calculator when the user opens the PDF file.

- To generate a custom exploit, run the script with three arguments: `<BAIT_NAME> <SCRIPT_NAME> <OUTPUT_NAME>`:

`python .\cve-2023-38831-exp-gen.py <ANY_PDF/PNG_FILE> <SCRIPT_NAME> <OUTPUT_NAME>`

`python cve-2023-38831-exp-gen.py CLASSIFIED_DOCUMENTS.pdf script.bat  poc.rar`

This will create a file named `<OUTPUT_NAME>` that contains a fake file named `<BAIT_NAME>` and a batch file named `<SCRIPT_NAME>`. The batch file will run the command that you have written in it when the user opens the fake file.

For example, if you want to create an exploit that contains a fake PNG/JPG file named `cute-cat.png` and a batch file named `script.bat` that runs a PowerShell command to download and execute a malicious payload from a remote server, you can run the script like this:

`python .\cve-2023-38831-exp-gen.py cute-cat.png script.bat evil.rar`
